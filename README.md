# ClickCrystals [1.19.3]
Allows you to crystal easier, by using left click to both place and detonate crystals.
## !!!***This is not a cheat***!!! One click place, one click break


### Commands
- ClickCrystalsToggle
  - Toggles click crystals
  - `/cctoggle [on|off|help]`
  - Aliases: 
    - `cctoggle`

### But, isn't it cheating?
- No, it is not.
  - Tested on multiple servers like PvPLegacy, McPvP, and USPvP
  - Saves the time of having to click one more unnessacary click
  - !*Does not replenish or auto-click, only makes it so that attacking a crystallable block with crystals will right click instead, not a cheat*!
  - !*You can only click the top of the crystallable block for it to work, no unfair advantages*!
