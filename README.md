## But isn't this cheating?
Yes, it is. (But only on some servers)
- Most of the time it isn't, this mod aims to improve your performance in cpvp without ruining its pure experience!
- This mod is a macro, just built-in to the game (so instead of emulating clicks, it does what the game does when it detects a click)
- This mod has been tested on:
  - `McPvP`.club
  - west.`UsPvP`.org
  - east.`UsPvP`.org
  - `OgreDupe`.minehut.gg

## For this Mod You Will Need
```yml
Minecraft Java Edition: 1.19.4
Fabric Loader: 0.14.14 or higher
Fabric API: 1.19.4
To stop: complaining it is a cheat/macro.
```
