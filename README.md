### A message from the developers:
Recently, there has been numerous reports of ClickCrystals being
a cheat because of NoBreakDelay. This message is here to ensure 
you that your complaints have been received. NoBreakDelay will be 
removed in version (0.9.1). 

Along with the (0.9.1) update, module settings are now provided,
which is something ClickCrystals has never had before. This will
motivate the playerbase to update their games and versions one
step closer to becoming cheat-free!

We'd like to apologize again for these troubles, and 
thank you for your understanding.

Happy coding and cpvping!

\- ClickCrystal dev team

## But isn't this cheating?
It is not a cheat. It does not automate any task, for every action the mod preforms, you have to click.
- This mod is not a macro, it does not click for you. It functions as a hotkey for slots.
- **This mod has been tested to not flag on (but might be bannable)**:
  - `McPvP`.club
  - west.`UsPvP`.org
  - east.`UsPvP`.org
  - `OgreDupe`.minehut.gg
  - play.`pvplegacy`.net
  - `donutsmp`.net

## For this Mod You Will Need
```yml
Minecraft Java Edition: 1.20.1
Fabric Loader: 0.14.21 or higher
Fabric API: 1.20.1
To stop: complaining it is a cheat/macro.
```
