### A message from the developers:
It has come to our attention that many people believe this mod is a "CW hack" or an unfair multiplayer advantage.
After being staff-banned off multiple well-known servers and taken down from Modrinth.com, we've decided to reconsider our decisions and revise our work.

In this update, unfair modules were removed, **all auto-clicking features** (thought of as Trigger Bot) are now gone, and **auto swap-back is also removed** (thought of as Auto Double Hand) With these changes, we hope, to those we have offended, would forgive us for the inconveniences we may have caused.

Now with all unfair modules removed, **this mod is officially a hotkey mod**, which helps you hotkey in certain situations. Note that this is not an unfair advantage, but rather a feature most mods have, ex Tweakeroo, Mouse Wheelie, and Item Scroller.

But then why download ClickCrystals if you can just download the mods mentioned above? ClickCrystals **contains many all-in-one features**, gathering all the smaller mods together and transforming them into module-like settings, allowing players to quickly configure their game to their liking. These mods may include NoHurtCam, NoGameOverlay, NoLoadingScreen, etc...

To those of you that still think this is cheating, this mod __**does NOT have autoclicking features, does NOT support flying and movement, and does NOT support renderering advantages**__. ClickCrystals is now just an all in one crystal pvp assistance mod, while adding a little twist with __hotkeying__.

Happy coding and cpvping!

## But isn't this cheating?
It is not a cheat. It does not automate any task, for every action the mod preforms, you have to click.
- This mod is not a macro, it does not click for you. It functions as a hotkey for slots.
- This mod has been tested on:
  - `McPvP`.club
  - west.`UsPvP`.org
  - east.`UsPvP`.org
  - `OgreDupe`.minehut.gg
  - play.`pvplegacy`.net

## For this Mod You Will Need
```yml
Minecraft Java Edition: 1.19.4
Fabric Loader: 0.14.14 or higher
Fabric API: 1.19.4
To stop: complaining it is a cheat/macro.
```
