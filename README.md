# ClickCrystals [1.19.3]
Allows you to crystal easier, by using left click to both place and detonate crystals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### !!!***This is not a cheat***!!! `One click place, one click break, just a different click method`.
#### `*Please take into account that this mod does NOT autoclick/replenish for the player, as that will be counted as an unfair advantage!*`
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How do I use it?
- Attack an obsidian or bedrock with an END CRYSTAL to place the crystal. DOES NOT AUTO CLICK/REPLENISH ANYTHING!

- Attack an obsidian or bedrock with an OBSIDIAN to scroll to the nearest crystal in your hotbar.

- Right clicking a respawn anchor with GLOWSTONE would scroll back to the respawn anchor in your hotbar after charging it.

- Right clicking a sword or totem would scroll to the nearest ender pearl in your hotbar.
- THIS MOD DOES NOT AUTO-CLICK/MACRO ANYTHING

### Commands
- `/clickcrystalstoggle`
  - Toggles click crystals
  - `/cctoggle` <`module`> [`on`|`off`|`help`]
  - Aliases: 
    - `cctoggle`

### But, isn't it cheating?
- No, it is not.
  - Tested on multiple servers like PvPLegacy, McPvP, and USPvP
  - Saves the time of having to click one more unnessacary click
  - !*Does not replenish or auto-click, only makes it so that attacking a crystallable block with crystals will right click instead, not a cheat*!
  - !*You can only click the top of the crystallable block for it to work, no unfair advantages*!
