## But isn't this cheating?
It is not a cheat. It does not automate any task, for every action the mod preforms, you have to click.
- This mod is not a macro, it does not click for you. It functions as a hotkey for slots.
- This mod has been tested on:
  - `McPvP`.club
  - west.`UsPvP`.org
  - east.`UsPvP`.org
  - `OgreDupe`.minehut.gg
  - play.`pvplegacy`.net

## For this Mod You Will Need
```yml
Minecraft Java Edition: 1.19.4
Fabric Loader: 0.14.14 or higher
Fabric API: 1.19.4
To stop: complaining it is a cheat/macro.
```
